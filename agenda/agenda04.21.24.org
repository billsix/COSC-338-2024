* Ask class about final papers, due date was already sent on google classroom.
I will also send a google classroom project for you guys to send your paper in.
* We have class this week, and that's it
* Final exam date TBD
* I did not assign homework that was supposed to be given out 04.09.
Students get 100% on it, as such
* Homework will be assigned on Wednesday 04.17, due a week from Wednesday 04.24
** Chapter 13, Basic Lighting
** Chapter 22, depth testing

based off of how the standard perspective matrix is defined, camera space z values
are not scaled linearly when transforming the z values to NDC.

This is good because it minimizes z-fighting for vertices close to the viewer.

You should be able to tell how to visualize the depth buffer.  Because we have fragment
shaders, we can control what color is set on a per-fragment basis

** Chapter 24, blending

understand discarding, an easy way to make fragments transparent.

Learn about alpha value, and the various ways to mix colors on the same fragment.

Show model view projection demo, demo 21, show how blending is used there.  rotate
the square to be in the line of sight of the paddle.
Look at it from both sides.
Students should be able to explain blending only works in one of the directions,
and makes the square disapppear in the other direction.

This is the same problem that the z buffer solved for us for triangles.

There are techniques for order-independent blending, covered in other texts,
such as the OpenGL SuperBible (blue book)

** Chapter 19-21, model loading

Gist here, is that everything we learned for one triangle can be applied
to a large mesh of triangles made by an artist.  The math is the same,
there's just a ton of triangles.

** Chapter 35, Shadow mapping
