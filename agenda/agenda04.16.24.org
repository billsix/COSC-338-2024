* Ask class about final papers
* We have class this week and next, and that's it.
* I did not assign homework that was supposed to be given out 04.09.
Students get 100% on it, as such
* Homework will be assigned on Wednesday 04.17, due a week from Wednesday 04.24
** Chapter 13, Basic Lighting
Start with section 13.5.
Normals should not be transformed the same was as modelspace data, with the MVP pipeline.
1) normals should not be translated.  Students should know how to ensure that
2) For a matrix that rotates and uniformly scales, that matrix could be applied
   to normals as well.  But if there is non-uniform scaling, if that matrix
   is applied to modelspace data, the resulting transformed normal may not
   be normal to the triangle.

   Let's say the matrix is called F, transforming to another space
   F*x

   let's say p is the vector from 2 points on the triangle, p is for
   parallel to the plane

   Let's say the normal, named t, is perpendicular
   We therefore know that t dot p = 0
   We therefore know that (t transposed) *  p = 0

   We'd like a matrix to transform normals, while keeping them parallel.
   Let's call this matrix G

   We'd like   (G*t)transposed * F*p = 0
   t transposed * G transposed * F*p = 0
   If G transposed * F is the identity matrix, then it works, because (t transposed) *  p = 0

   G transposed * F = I
   G transposed * F = I
   G transposed = F^-1 * I
   G transposed = F^-1
   G = F^-1 transposed

** know ambient, diffuse, and specular (learn Blinn-Phong, with the half angles - it looks better and is easier to understand, page 273

** Chapter 14, Materials

The beginning starts off weird. with too much light.
It's better on page 129 where the material has non-1 values for ambient, diffuse, and specular.

*** Skip lighting maps, skip specular maps
