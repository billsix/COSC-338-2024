**** Matrix matrix multiplication
This is what we did earlier in the class with function composition, the lambda stack, and the matrix stack.
We can think of a 3x3 matrix M muliplied by another 3x3 matrix N, as multiplying M by the 3 vectors that are the
columns of matrix N, and then using the three resulting vectors to create a new matrix, that composes the two
transformations together.
**** Scaling
Should be straightforward if we look at the columns of the matrix to be the "new" x, y, and z vectors
**** Translation
We make our vectors use a fourth component, w, which we define to always be one, with the exception
of after the perspective projection.  Since the perspective projection is the last step of the MVP pipeline,
we never need to use it for translation afterwards, so having a value of non-one is not an issue.
By giving it a value of one for every step of the MVP pipeline, we can embed a translation vector
as the fourth column of the matrix.  Why does this matter?  It means that we can embed arbitary sequence
of rotations and translations and scaling into 1 matrix for the whole MVP pipeline.  The alternative
would be to have to keep track of much more values.
**** Rotations
We've talked about this extensively before, but these are the matrix forms.  Bill, draw up on the board
what the columns of the matrix look like.
***** Combining matricies
This is done by premultiplying matricies together.  I recommend against trying to get and geometric
intuition from matricies in the form.  Instead, I like to view each matrix as doing one thing, and
having a composition of them.  However, premuliplied matricies in a computer provide much more
efficient execution.
*** GLM
A C++ library for making a sequence of transformations, similar to what we've already seen.
** Chapter 9, coordinate systems
We can skip most of this
** Chapter 10, camera
Demonstrate how the author constructs a matrix, specifiying camera position, what it should look
towards (down the camera's negative z axis). Understand how the author uses the cross product
to construct the matrix
*** Look at
The look at matrix represents the world space to camera space transformation.
Given that the inverse of an orthonormal matrix is the transpose, (Bill, make sure you
explain this), what would the cameraspace to world space transformation be?  How would
you read it, left to right, or right to left?
*** Bill, run the code for 1.getting_started/7.4.camera_class/
