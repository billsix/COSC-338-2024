** Ask about programming project due Wednesday
Has everyone got the demos up and running?
** Discuss first homework assignment (as compared to programming assignment)
** Ask for questions so far.
** Demo 3 - Window sizing and proportionality
   This is my least favorite section of my book
   Most of these functions are ones that you can look up, copy and paste,
     so it's kind of like trivia
   It's not important that you understand all of this section yet.
   I cover this section first because it's a base from which to
     build the Cayley graphs.
