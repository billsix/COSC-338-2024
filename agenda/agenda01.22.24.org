  Show people how to look at github, and the history of files
** Demo 1 - Opening a Window with GLFW
*** Run the demo
*** Read the webpage
*** [ask class who got python installed and can run a demo]
*** Show about Python REPL, including importing modules]
*** Show how to install Spyder IDE
    use command line, and run modelviewprojection's demos with it
    "python -m pip install spyder"
*** Visual Studio, with the python extension, handles
    - importing projects from Git
    - commiting
    - creating python virtual environments
** Demo 2 - Normalized Device Coordinates
*** Run the demo
*** Read the webpage
    Use coins while discussing the Cayley graph
    Can understand the functions one of two ways, going with the arrow, or against
    When going with, 1 nickel gets converted into 5 pennies
      so, f(x) = 5 * x
    When going against the arrow, 1 penny turns into 1 nickel
      so it's value is now, f(x) = 5 * x
*** Resize the window while its running to show problems with NDC
** Show gist of first assignment, which is not yet assigned, hence no due date
*** Run it
*** Show Event loop
*** Show how time is acquired
*** Show how all coordinates are in NDC, not screen space
*** Show how to use trig functions from the math module.
*** Show how one would use degrees instead of radians
*** Show how one could make a graphing calculator from -1 to 1
***** Using points defined before program execution
***** For an arbitrary function
      discuss inner functions
      discuss range, arange
      discuss for loops
      discuss lambdas - ask about familiarity with lambda functions in java
        http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/lambda-expressions.html
      rewrite the lambda to be a function to see if it adds clarity
** Demo 3 - Window sizing and proportionality
   This is my least favorite section of my book
   Most of these functions are ones that you can look up, copy and paste,
     so it's kind of like trivia
   It's not important that you understand all of this section yet.
   I cover this section first because it's a base from which to
     build the Cayley graphs.
*** Run the demo
