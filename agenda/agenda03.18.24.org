* Covered Demo 20 from MVP.
Talked about how shaders were introduced, but the API was
more or less unclanged, just augmented with shaders, with
predefined variable names in the shaders
* Covered Demo 21, OpenGL 3.3
Talked about how we push modelspace data to the graphics card,
to not have to push it from the CPU to the video cards VRAM
every frame.  The data is pushed into VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects).
Since we no longer have many predefined names in the shaders,
we need to link how to get data out of the VBO and into the shader,
which we do by making a VAO (Vertex Array Object).
The LearnOpenGL book that we are going to study does a better
job explaining these steps than I did in class.
* Started reading the PDF from LearnOpenGL.
I will email a copy of the book to all of the students.  We ended today
on page 13.
